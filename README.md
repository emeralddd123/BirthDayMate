Task Scheduling
---------------

This project showcases task scheduling using `node-cron` for sending daily birthday wishes. Task scheduling is useful in various real-life scenarios, such as:

*   **Subscription Renewals:** Schedule reminders for subscription renewals, preventing service interruptions for users with expiring subscriptions.
*   **Payment Processing:** Automate recurring payment processing for subscriptions or services with fixed billing intervals.
*   **Data Backups:** Schedule regular data backups to prevent data loss and ensure the integrity of your application.
*   **Email Campaigns:** Plan and execute targeted email campaigns by scheduling email deliveries at specific times.
*   **Maintenance Tasks:** Schedule routine maintenance tasks, such as database cleanup or index optimization, during low-traffic periods.
